<p>This map was created using log entries and correspondence found in U.S. Office of Naval Records and Library, <em>Naval Documents Related to the United States Wars with the Barbary Powers</em>, 6 vols. (Washington: U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1939).</p>
<p>To determine approximate latitudes and longitudes based on the information in the logs, sometimes calculations are necessary. To perform these calculations, I used <a href="http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html">this series of scripts</a> by Chris Veness.</p>
